We develop a visual-tactile sensor which is based on Gelsight sensor put forward by Johnson in 2009. 
In applying our sensor, we are able to get comprehensive force information including shear force, normal force, and tangential force, 
during the robot grasping or motion planning. On the other hand, shape and texture of the contacting surface can be constructed 
using the method called photometric stereo. This enables us to realize more complicated robotic tasks such as tape manipulation.
