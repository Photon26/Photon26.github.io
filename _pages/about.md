I am currently a first year PhD student at Harada Lab, the Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University. 
I am supervised by Associate Professor [Weiwei Wan](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/) and Professor [Kensuke Harada](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/members-old/%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%B0%E7%A0%94%E4%BB%8B/). 
My current research focus is on robot manipulation using a Gelsight sensor.

I received my master’s degree at Osaka University in 2021. 
I earned my bachelor’s degree at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2018 and was the runner-up winner in the 7th China Undergraduate Physics Tournament ([CUPT](https://pt.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm)).
