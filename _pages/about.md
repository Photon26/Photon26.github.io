I am currently a D1 student at the Graduate School of Engineering Science in Osaka University, 
supervised by Prof. [Weiwei Wan](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/) and Prof. [Kensuke Harada](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/members-old/%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%B0%E7%A0%94%E4%BB%8B/).
My current research is about robot manipulation applying a Gelsight sensor.

I received my master's degree at Osaka University in 2021, supervised by Prof. [Weiwei Wan](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/) and Prof. [Kensuke Harada](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/members-old/%E5%8E%9F%E7%94%B0%E7%A0%94%E4%BB%8B/).
I earned my bachelor's degree at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2018.
